 projet analyse Ncovmemory
In this project, I want to analyse with R the the texts linked by another repository:NcovMemory2019, which is a collection of link to articles about Coronavirus in China. As much as doing the analysis, it is an opportunity for me to learn R and get better at it. Looking back, Python might have been more appropriate since the author of NcovMemory seems to use Python but that's for later.
