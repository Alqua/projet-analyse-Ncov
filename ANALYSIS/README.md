As stated earlier I did three kind of analysis:
- Data graphs on articles
- LDA theme analysis
- Maps

# GRAPHS
The code to generate them can be found in [GRAPHS with R](https://github.com/Alqua/projet-analyse-Ncov/tree/master/ANALYSIS/GRAPHS%20with%20R)

# LDA
The process begins with downloading the articles in [DOWNLOAD ARTICLES with R](https://github.com/Alqua/projet-analyse-Ncov/tree/master/ANALYSIS/DOWNLOAD%20ARTICLES%20with%20R),
continues with [CLEANING articles](https://github.com/Alqua/projet-analyse-Ncov/tree/master/ANALYSIS/CLEANING%20articles) and finally ends with the actual [LDA](https://github.com/Alqua/projet-analyse-Ncov/tree/master/ANALYSIS/LDA) analysis.

# MAPS
the files aren't available yet.

# [DATFRAMES](https://github.com/Alqua/projet-analyse-Ncov/tree/master/ANALYSIS/DATAFRAMES)
Contains dataframes used to generate the analysis or dataframes generated for analysis. It could also be considered as another form of analysis.
